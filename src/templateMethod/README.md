##Template Method Pattern

* The fundamental aim of this pattern is "reuse of code"
* We need to minimize the number of incomplete/abstract operations (In Java, abstract method doesn't have a body). Otherwise, each of the subclasses needs to override them and the overall process will lose the effectiveness of this design pattern.
