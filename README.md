## Java Design Patterns: A Tour with 23 Gang of Four Design Patterns in Java (Vaskaran Sarcar)

# Creational Patterns
Mainly deal with instantiation/ creation process.
1. Singleton
Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide global point of access to it. 

2. Abstract Factory
3. Prototype
4. Factory
5. Bulider

# Structural Patterns
Focus on how objects and classes are associated or can be composed to make relatively large structures.
1. Proxy
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. We want to use a class which can perform as an interface to something else.

2. Flyweight
3. Bridge
4. Facade
5. Decorator
6. Adapter
7. Composite

# Behavioral Patterns
Focus on algorithms and the assignment of critical responsibilities among objects. And also communication between them.
1. Observer
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all it dependents are notified and updated automatically. Also referred to as Publisher-Subscriber model.

2. Template Method
3. Command
4. Iterator
5. State
6. Mediator
7. Strategy
8. Chain of Responsibility
9. Visitor
10. Interpreter
11. Memento
