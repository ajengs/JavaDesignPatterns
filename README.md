## Java Design Patterns: A Tour with 23 Gang of Four Design Patterns in Java (Vaskaran Sarcar)

# Creational Patterns
Mainly deal with instantiation/ creation process.
1. Singleton.
Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide global point of access to it. 

2. Abstract Factory
3. Prototype
4. Factory
5. Bulider

# Structural Patterns
Focus on how objects and classes are associated or can be composed to make relatively large structures.
1. Proxy.
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. We want to use a class which can perform as an interface to something else.

2. Flyweight
3. Bridge
4. Facade
5. Decorator. Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Provide flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. Applying Open/Closed principle.

6. Adapter
7. Composite

# Behavioral Patterns
Focus on algorithms and the assignment of critical responsibilities among objects. And also communication between them.
1. Observer.
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all it dependents are notified and updated automatically. Also referred to as Publisher-Subscriber model.

2. Template Method. Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. The template method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

3. Command
4. Iterator
5. State
6. Mediator
7. Strategy
8. Chain of Responsibility
9. Visitor
10. Interpreter
11. Memento
